Feature 1: Voice-Based Record Fetching with Confirmation Prompt
This feature allows an officer to speak the name or case ID of a person, and the system fetches the related record. Before showing sensitive information, it confirms the identity with the officer through a voice prompt, preventing errors and improving data security.

Feature 2: Speech-Based Form Filling with Narration First + Guided Follow-Up
This feature lets the officer fill out an incident report through a conversation. 

Feature 3: Summarize Speech Input â€“ Incident Dictation and Shift Summary
This feature allows officers to verbally describe an incident or summarize their shift at the end of the day. The system converts the spoken input into a concise, structured summary that can be saved or reviewed quickly, reducing manual reporting time.
